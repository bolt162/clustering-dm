# Clustering Assignment

This repository contains nine Google Colab notebooks demonstrating a range of clustering algorithms and modern embedding-based clustering techniques. Each notebook includes documentation, code, visualizations, and clustering quality metrics.

## Notebooks
1. **K-Means from Scratch**  
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**  
3. **Gaussian Mixture Models**  
4. **DBSCAN using PyCaret**  
5. **Anomaly Detection with PyOD**  
6. **Time Series Clustering with Pretrained Models**  
7. **Document Clustering with LLM Embeddings**  
8. **Image Clustering with ImageBind Embeddings**  
9. **Audio Clustering with ImageBind or Similar Embeddings**

## Datasets
Datasets are sourced from public repositories, including Papers With Code.

## How to Run
Open each notebook in Google Colab and run all cells in order. Setup and installation steps are provided within each notebook.
